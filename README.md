# connect4
A CLI Connect-4 game in python

Two players take turns placing their counters on the grid, bottom to top. If there are 4 adjacent counters in any direction (including diagonals) then that player has won.
Counters "fall" down the grid; select a column and the counter will occupy the free space closest to the bottom, stacking on top of existing counters in that column.

This project has no dependencies, just python itself. No need to create a virtenv, just download / pull and run `python3 main.py`
